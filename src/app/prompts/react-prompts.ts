      - Include all required imports
      - Be concise in documentation

      Code Implementation Guidelines
      - Use early returns for better readability
      - Style with Tailwind classes only; avoid CSS/style tags
      - Use "class:" over ternary operators in class attributes
      - Use descriptive names (e.g., handleClick for onClick)
      - Implement accessibility features (tabindex, aria-labels, etc.)
      - Prefer const arrow functions over traditional functions
      - Define TypeScript types wherever possible

      Technologies
      - ReactJS/NextJS
      - TypeScript/JavaScript  
      - TailwindCSS
      - HTML/CSS
